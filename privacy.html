  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: August 08, 2025</p>

  <p>At One Click Productivity ("We", "Us", or "Our"), your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>Definition of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Personal Data means any information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address, phone number, IP address, or other information that can be used to identify you.</p>

  <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>We want to be clear: <strong>We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from users of our application.</strong> Your use of the app does not require you to provide any personal information.</p>

  <h2>Permissions and Why We Use Them</h2>
  <p>To provide key features of our app, we request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Foreground Service Permission</strong>: This allows the app to run certain background tasks reliably, in this case for the recurring todos functionality, ensuring uninterrupted functionality. This is a normal-level permission automatically granted by the system at install time and does not require user approval during app use.</li>
    <li><strong>Query All Packages Permission</strong>: This permission lets the app detect which other apps are installed on your device. It is necessary to select the apps affected by appblocking. This is a normal-level permission automatically granted by the system at install time and does not require user approval during app use.</li>
    <li><strong>System Alert Window Permission</strong>: This permission allows the app to display overlays on top of other apps, in this case the "window/overlay" that appears when a blocked app is opened. This permission can be removed at any point manually in the system settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Service Permission</strong>: This permission enables the app to monitor and interact with the device's user interface, in this case to detect when a blocked app is opened and to close the app when the "Close-Button" on the "Overlay/Block - Window" is pressed. This permission can be removed at any point manually in the system settings.</li>  
  </ul>
  <p>We use these permissions only to deliver the described features above and do not use them to collect or share your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>While we do not collect and share personal data, please be aware that some third-party services we use (such as Google Play Services) may automatically collect certain usage data. This data is handled according to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Our app does not use cookies or tracking technologies directly. However, third-party services integrated with the app may use cookies or similar technologies.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
  <p>By continuing to access or use the website and the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and the Service.</p>
